## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

1. The first thing that happens,  your browser (i.e. Chrome) goes to the **DNS** server and finds the "real" web address of the server that the website you are searching for on.
2. The browser sends an **HTTP** request message to the server, asking the server to send a copy of the website to the client. This information is sent across your internet connection using **TCP/IP**.
3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a *"200 OK"*, then starts sending the website's files to the browser in small chunks called **data packets**.
4. The browser assembles the **data packets** into a complete website and displays it to you. 

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

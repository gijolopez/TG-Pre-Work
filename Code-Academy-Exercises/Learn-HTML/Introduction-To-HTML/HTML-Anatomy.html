<!--Let's quickly review each part of the element pictured:

HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.


** OVERVIEW of HTML**
Let's review what you've learned so far:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags .
Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.

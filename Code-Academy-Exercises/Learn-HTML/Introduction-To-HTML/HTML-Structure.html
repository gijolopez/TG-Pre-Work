<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
	<p>This paragraph is a child of the div 		element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>

<!--Let's consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body</h1>
    <p>Sibling to h1, but also grandchild of body</p>
  </div>
</body>
In this example, the <body> element is the parent of the <div> element.
Both the <h1> and <p> elements are children of the <div> element.
Because the <h1> and <p> elements are at the same level,
they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> element.

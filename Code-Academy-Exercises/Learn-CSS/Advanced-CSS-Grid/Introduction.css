Introduction
In the previous lesson, you learned all the foundational properties necessary to create a two-dimensional grid-based layout for your web pages! In this lesson, you'll learn the following additional properties that you can use to harness the power of CSS Grid Layout:

grid-template-areas
justify-items
justify-content
justify-self
align-items
align-content
align-self
grid-auto-rows
grid-auto-columns
grid-auto-flow
You will also learn about the explicit and implicit grids and grid axes.

Review
Great work! You have learned many new properties to use when creating a layout using CSS Grid! Let's review:

grid-template-areas specifies grid named grid areas
grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
grid-auto-columns specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
grid-auto-flow specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created
This is a great time to experiment with the code in the code editor and try any of the properties you want to practice more! When you're ready, move on!

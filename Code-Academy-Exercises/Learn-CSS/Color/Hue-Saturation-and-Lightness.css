/* Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. If you imagine a line segment drawn from the center of the color wheel to the perimeter, the saturation is a point on that line segment. If you spin that line segment to different angles, you'll see how that saturation looks for different hues. The saturation increases towards 100% as the point gets closer to the edge (the color becomes more rich). The saturation decreases towards 0% as the point gets closer to the center (the color becomes more gray).

Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light switch that starts halfway. Sliding the dimmer up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white. Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black.

HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. In RGB, making the color a little darker may affect all three color components. In HSL, that's as easy as changing the lightness value. HSL is also useful for making a set of colors that work well together by selecting various colors that have the same lightness and saturation but different hues.

Introduction to Color
CSS supports a wide variety of colors. These include named colors, like blue, black, and LimeGreen, along with colors described by a numeric value. Using a numeric system allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support. In this lesson, we're going to explore all the color options CSS offers.

Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
We'll learn about and explore the benefits of each of these in depth. Using only named colors, you may feel like you're picking labeled crayons out of a box. By the end of this lesson, you'll feel like a painter mixing paints on a palette.


Color Review
We've completed our extensive tour of the colors in CSS! Let's review the key information we've learned.

There are four ways to represent color in CSS:

Named colors — there are 147 named colors, which you can review here.

Hexadecimal or hex colors

Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by "A" to "F".
Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers such as #23F41A.
RGB

RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.
RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).
HSL

HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).
You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a percentage.

Great job! Feel empowered to add a bit of color to each of your projects!
